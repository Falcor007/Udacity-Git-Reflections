When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Probably when I'm working on multiple computers or collaborating with
	others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Allows for greater control of timing/merging.  Your local repository may be
	the most up-to-date repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Cloning a GitHub repository onto my own GitHub account.
	Clones: Making a duplicate repository, usually between local and remote.
	Branches: The "paths" of a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
