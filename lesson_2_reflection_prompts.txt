What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Nothing happens when you initialize a repository -- git simply sets up a
	framework for its functionality, namely creating a ".git" folder.  All this
	simply lets git know that it should start tracking this project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a temporary spot  where files are placed before
	packaging it all together as a single commit.  The working directory is the
	file folder that currently holds your files.  The repository is the place
	where all your commit packages are stored.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	I can treat the staging area as a temporary bin to group items into one set
	of logical changes.
